Jenkins is an open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) in software development. It automates various stages of the software development lifecycle, including building, testing, and deploying software.
Key aspects of Jenkins:
Continuous Integration (CI): Jenkins automatically pulls code changes from version control systems (like Git), builds the project, and runs automated tests whenever changes are committed. This helps identify integration issues early in the development process.
Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD): Beyond CI, Jenkins can automate the process of delivering or deploying software to various environments (e.g., staging, production) after successful builds and tests.
Open-Source and Extensible: Jenkins is open-source and boasts a vast plugin ecosystem. These plugins allow integration with a wide range of tools and technologies, such as build tools (Maven, Gradle), testing frameworks, containerization platforms (Docker, Kubernetes), and cloud providers.
Pipeline as Code: Jenkins 2 introduced "Pipeline as Code," enabling users to define their CI/CD pipelines using Groovy-based scripts within their project's repository, promoting version control and collaboration for pipeline definitions.
Server-Based Architecture: Jenkins typically runs as a server, often within a Java application server like Jetty or Apache Tomcat, providing a central hub for managing and orchestrating automation tasks.
Flexibility and Customization: Its extensive plugin library and scripting capabilities allow teams to tailor Jenkins to their specific project requirements and workflows, supporting diverse development practices and technologies.
